\chapter{Psychological background}

%Establishing a stronger connection between rational
%models of cognition and psychological mechanisms has
%been a goal of cognitive scientists at least since Simon
%(1957) introduced the notion of bounded rationality. Several different strategies for taking into account the effects
%of information-processing constraints have been considered, including incorporating those constraints into the
%optimization process involved in rational analysis (e.g.,
%Anderson, 1990), handicapping rational models to produce behavior closer to that of human participants (e.g.,
%Steyvers, Tenenbaum, Wagenmakers, & Blum, 2003), and
%rejecting the principle of optimization altogether in favor
%of finding simple but effective heuristics (e.g., Gigerenzer
%& Todd, 1999).
